# Expo Android Build Failure: Gradle, SDK, or Build Tools Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android apps with Expo CLI. The problem relates to inconsistencies or corruption within the Android SDK, Gradle, or build tools.  This often leads to cryptic error messages during the build process.

The `expoBug.js` file simulates the scenario where a developer attempts to build an app, leading to a build failure.  The `expoBugSolution.js` file offers several solutions to troubleshoot and resolve the error.

Solutions include checking SDK version consistency, cleaning the project's cache, and potentially reinstalling the Android SDK components.   The README provides detailed steps for each solution.
