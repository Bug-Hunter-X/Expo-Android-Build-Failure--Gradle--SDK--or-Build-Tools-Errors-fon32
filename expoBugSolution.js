The solutions revolve around ensuring the correct configuration and installation of Android SDK components and Gradle. Steps include:

1. **Check Android SDK and Build Tools Versions:** Verify that the versions are compatible with the Expo CLI version and your project's requirements. Use the Android SDK Manager to check and update components.
2. **Clean the Project Cache:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to remove any cached build artifacts that might be causing conflicts.   Also consider clearing the Gradle cache (usually located in `~/.gradle`).
3. **Reinstall the Android SDK:** As a last resort, uninstall and reinstall the Android SDK, ensuring all necessary packages are selected.
4. **Update Gradle Wrapper:** Ensure you're using the latest Gradle wrapper by checking your `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file.
5. **Verify JAVA_HOME and ANDROID_HOME Environment Variables:**  Make sure your environment is properly configured with the paths to your JDK and Android SDK. 
6. **Check for Errors in `android/gradle.properties`:** Review the file for typos or incorrect configurations. 
7. **Check for Errors in `android/app/build.gradle`:** Review the file for typos or incorrect configurations.
